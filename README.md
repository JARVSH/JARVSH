JARVSH (Just A Rather Very Smart House) is a smart digital assistant, inspired from Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.

This project can be implemented in any existing smart home project, using this voice assistance as the controlling unit. It uses a Speech to Text engine to get commands from user and a Text to Speech engine to give feedback. JARVSH uses natural language processing to answer questions and perform action by delegating requests to different web services like Wikipedia and Wolfram|Alpha. Further functionality can be added to it with ease, and which will be added eventually.

For starters, who don't follow iron man you can think of JARVSH like iOS's  Siri like system which controls the complete home instead  of just the iDevice, and answers all your queries like Siri as well.

The code for JARVSH is live at the github repository: github.com/JARVSH
